      <p class="WalkTitle1"> The Physical Benefits of Walking</p>
        <p class="WalkPara1">Past studies have supported this notion, finding that a daily walk can reduce the risk of stroke in both men and women, reduce the days spent in a hospital each year and can even lower your risk of death by up to 39 percent (when compared with no leisure-time physical activity). A study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that those who adhered to a walking program showed significant improvements in blood pressure, slowing of resting heart rate, reduction of body fat and body weight, reduced cholesterol, improved depression scores with better quality of life and increased measures of endurance. The faster, farther and more frequently you walk, the greater the benefits. For example, you may start out as an average walker, and then work your way up to walking faster and walking a mile in a shorter amount of time than an average walker, similar to power walkers. This can be a great way to get aerobic activity, improve your heart health and increase your endurance while burning calories.</p>
      <p class="WalkTitle2">The Mental Benefits of Walking</p>
        <p class="WalkPara2">One Stanford University study found that walking increased creative output by an average of 60 percent. Researchers labelled this type of creativity “divergent thinking,” which they define as a thought process used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. According to the study, “walking opens up the free flow of ideas, and it is a simple and robust solution to the goals of increasing creativity and increasing physical activity. But it’s not only your creativity that will benefit from the mental lift. The act of walking is also a proven mood booster. One study found that just 12 minutes of walking resulted in an increase in joviality, vigor, attentiveness and self-confidence versus the same time spent sitting. Walking in nature, specifically, was found to reduce ruminating over negative experiences, which increases activity in the brain associated with negative emotions and raises risk of depression. The mental health benefits of walking outdoors will last many years, even into old age. Ample studies show that people who used to walk outdoors continue to thrive as seniors and lead a great quality of life with a sound mind. Remember, though, you have to walk regularly to get the true benefits. Moreover, depending on your age and fitness level, you can also perform aerobics, weight lifting, pilates, and many other activities besides or in addition to walking. At the end of the day, physical exercise is not all about losing weight; if the exercise makes you feel happy and refreshes your mind- that is the most important. ”</p>
