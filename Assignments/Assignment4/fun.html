      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
      <p>Unlike most marine mammals, they don't have a layer of blubber. But, they do have the thickest fur of all animals.</p>
      <p>An otter pup's fur is too dense for it to swim underwater. So, their mother leaves them floating while she searches for food, until their adult fur grows in.</p>
      <p>Thirteen different species of otter exist all around the world. Some are small river otters, and some are bigger sea otters.</p>
      <p>They like to eat sea urchins, clams, mussels and crabs. They use their sea whiskers to find small creatures to eat, and their paws to dig for clams.</p>
