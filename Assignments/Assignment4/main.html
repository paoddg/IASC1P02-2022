      <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
      <p>
        Travelling and connecting with places and people is so important to us, it’s the cornerstone of why Welcome to Travel exists. We believe that travelling broadens the mind and changes the way you think. The people you meet and the experiences you have give you an improved ability to empathise with different situations and people. Travel is the best way to learn about the world and how it works. Our experiences both travelling and working in travel have led us to where we are today, and to Welcome to Travel’s Mission Statement, Vision Statement and Values.
