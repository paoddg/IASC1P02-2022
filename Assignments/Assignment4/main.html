      <h3>Mental Health - What is it?</h3>
        <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO)Trusted Source: “Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community.”</p>
        <p>The WHO states that mental health is “more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.” Peak mental health is not only about managing active conditions but also looking after ongoing wellness and happiness. It also emphasizes that preserving and restoring mental health is crucial individually and at a community and society level.</p>
      <h3>Risk factors for mental health conditions</h3>
        <p>Everyone is at some risk of developing a mental health disorder, regardless of age, sex, income, or ethnicity. In the U.S. and much of the developed world, mental disorders are one of the leading causes of disability. Social and financial circumstances, adverse childhood experiences, biological factors, and underlying medical conditions can all shape a person’s mental health.</p>
        <p>Many people with a mental health disorder have more than one condition at a time. It is important to note that good mental health depends on a delicate balance of factors and that several elements may contribute to developing these disorders.</p>
      <h3>Types of mental health disorders</h3>
        <p>Specific mental disorders are grouped together due to features they have in common. Some types of mental illness are as follows:
      <ul><b>Anxiety disorders</b></ul>
      <ul><b>Mood disorders</b></ul>
      <ul><b>Schizophrenia disorders</b></ul></p>
      <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
      <p>Diagnosing a mental health disorder requires a multi-step process. A doctor may begin by looking at a person’s medical history and performing a thorough physical exam to rule out physical conditions or issues that may be causing the symptoms. No medical tests can diagnose mental disorders. However, doctors may order a series of laboratory tests such as imaging exams and bloodwork to screen for other possible underlying causes.</p>
<p> They will also do a psychological evaluation. This includes asking about a person’s symptoms, experiences, and how these have impacted their lives. Sometimes, the doctor may ask a person to fill out mental health questionnaires to get an idea about a person’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior patterns. Most mental health specialists use the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to make a diagnosis. This manual contains descriptions and specific criteria to qualify for a diagnosis.</p>
