        In the last couple of years I've been getting more into playing video
        games. I mainly play PC games but sometimes I'll change it up with some
        PS4, 3DS, and even some mobile games if I'm laying in bed looking for
        something to pass the time. I also really like dogs. A lot of my time at
        home is spent taking care of my dog, going on walks with her, or taking
        her to the dog park. After she's all tired out, she sits by me on the
        couch while I play video games. I went to the gym and did some weight
        lifting for the first time in my life this week, and although I haven't
        yet made it part of my routine, I'd love to one day be able to call
        working out an interest of mine.

      <h4>goals</h4>
      <p>
        My main goal after graduation is to be able to support myself through
        just stage management, which is a pretty lofty thing in itself. I'd also
        love to have a nice house with a big backyard and huge windows so I can
        always be close to the outdoors (but still be able to stay in when it's
        too cold outside). I'd also love to bring a couple more dogs into the
        mix. The thing about theatre is that it's not really a trusty way to pay
        the bills, so one of my other goals is to stick with programming and
        keep it fun for myself (and maybe I'll be able to make some money off it
        on the side). Another one of my goals is to become more fit! I think
        that a person's mental health and physical health are very much tied in
        with each other, and so I've recently been trying to work both of those
        further up my list of priorities, so I can make taking care of myself a
        habit before my body starts to turn on me. So I guess one of my goals is
        just to be a happier and healthier person all around.
