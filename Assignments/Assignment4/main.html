      <h4>goals</h4>
      <p>
        My main goal after graduation is to be able to support myself through
        just stage management, which is a pretty lofty thing in itself. I'd also
        love to have a nice house with a big backyard and huge windows so I can
        always be close to the outdoors (but still be able to stay in when it's
        too cold outside). I'd also love to bring a couple more dogs into the
        mix. The thing about theatre is that it's not really a trusty way to pay
        the bills, so one of my other goals is to stick with programming and
        keep it fun for myself (and maybe I'll be able to make some money off it
        on the side). Another one of my goals is to become more fit! I think
        that a person's mental health and physical health are very much tied in
        with each other, and so I've recently been trying to work both of those
        further up my list of priorities, so I can make taking care of myself a
        habit before my body starts to turn on me. So I guess one of my goals is
        just to be a happier and healthier person all around.
