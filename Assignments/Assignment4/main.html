      <h3>Mental Healt - What is it?</h3>
        <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO)Trusted Source: “Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community.”</p>
        <p>The WHO states that mental health is “more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.” Peak mental health is not only about managing active conditions but also looking after ongoing wellness and happiness. It also emphasizes that preserving and restoring mental health is crucial individually and at a community and society level.</p>
      <h3>Risk factors for mental health conditions</h3>
        <p>Everyone is at some risk of developing a mental health disorder, regardless of age, sex, income, or ethnicity. In the U.S. and much of the developed world, mental disorders are one of the leading causes of disability. Social and financial circumstances, adverse childhood experiences, biological factors, and underlying medical conditions can all shape a person’s mental health.</p>
        <p>Many people with a mental health disorder have more than one condition at a time. It is important to note that good mental health depends on a delicate balance of factors and that several elements may contribute to developing these disorders.</p>
      <h3>Types of mental health disorders</h3>
        <p>Specific mental disorders are grouped together due to features they have in common. Some types of mental illness are as follows:
<ul>
anxiety disorders
mood disorders
schizophrenia disorders</ul></p>
      <h3>Threats</h3>
      <p>Otters and their mustelid relatives were once hunted extensively for their fur, many to the point of near extinction. Despite regulations designed to protect them, many species remain at risk from pollution and habitat loss. The sea otter is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List, pressured by pollution, pesticides, and conflicts with fishermen who kill them for eating their fish. Asian otter species also face threats from the illegal pet trade.</p>
