<h2> Why is Mental Health Important </h2>
<p>
  <strong>Mental health</strong> is a topic that gets stigmatized so often in our society. If someone is having a mental health issue, they are less likely to get help because of that stigma and shame. But there’s nothing to be ashamed of. The wirings of your brain are not your fault. Yet, we act like it is our fault and discount its importance. Mental illness also gets misunderstood by those who have never experienced it. It becomes up to us to advocate for our needs and educate others about our issues.There is a spectrum of how we experience things. We may sometimes lose control but regain it overall. Or we may experience the extremes of <em>high and low</em> emotions and not be able to cope. We may fall somewhere in between.
</p>
<h3>There are three reasons why mental health is so important.</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Mental Health Affects Physical Health</li>
  <li>End Stigma and Shame to Lead Better Lives</li>
  <li>Mental Health Affects Everything</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    If you experience any of these issues, it’s time to reach out for help. Mental health issues are important. It’s important to learn and care about them because if we don’t, all the aforementioned things could happen. Mental health affects everything. It affects our nature and how we interact with the world and ourselves. Without good mental health, we are susceptible to not knowing our full worth and struggling with things that are beyond our control. When we ignore mental health, we ignore ourselves. We must value our health and wellness as much as we value anything, if not more. We must learn that we are good enough – that we are worthy of compassion and that others are too. This leads us to have higher standards. It helps us feel sad if we want to feel sad, accepting our state of mind. And it also helps us do something about it. We don’t have to wait to feel better – we can feel better today simply by acknowledging our struggles as real and worth paying compassionate attention towards. <strong> We can’t function if we’re not doing well but when we turn this around and have good mental health, many good things can happen:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>We learn to cope again.</li>
<li>We become healthy in all aspects.</li>
<li>Our relationships no longer suffer.</li>
<li>We find meaning in our day to day lives.</li>
<li>We become more involved in our community.</li>
<li>We are more productive at school or at work.</li>
<li>We can be the person we are meant to be.</li>
</ul>
